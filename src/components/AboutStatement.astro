    I&apos;m a junior software / web developer from San Antonio, Texas with a
    passion for expanding my skillset. I am a recent graduate from Texas
    A&amp;M - San Antonio where I studied computer science and will be
    continuing to study it as I work on my MS Computer Science. I have a
    background in Java, Python, and various web technologies such as React,
    Svelte, and Vue. Other interests include the Rust and Zig programming
    languages.
