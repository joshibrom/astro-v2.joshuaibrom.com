## About

This website is intended to be used as more of a personal portfolio for myself.
Since graduating I've been wanting to create a new version of my personal website
and have finally gotten around to it.

Building out this site was relatively simple, albeit not without its issues (I could
not get `sharp` to work on my Macbook no matter what I tried and thus am using
Sqoosh for image optimization). Overall, I'm happy with the result and feel much more
proud of this version both stylistically and in terms of performance.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- This website is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/), a static site generator
  boasting a modern developer experience with a focus on performance and extensibility.
  Markdown files are used to generate some pages (like this one).
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used for styling.

## Previous Versions

- You may view v1 (the previous Astro-based version) [here](https://v1.joshuaibrom.com/).
- Some previous versions of this website have been built with the following technologies
  (in order of most recent to least recent):
  1. React
  1. Django
  1. Vanilla HTML, CSS, JS: Built my senior year of high school (2016-2017)
